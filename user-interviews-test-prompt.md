**User Behavioral Patterns:**
• 89% of users prefer mobile-first interactions for scheduling and messaging
• Peak usage hours: 7-9 AM and 6-8 PM (before and after work schedules)
• Users abandon complex workflows after 3+ steps (68% drop-off rate observed)
• Trust is critical: 94% want clear privacy and security indicators
• Older patients (65+) prefer voice calls over text-based communication (2:1 ratio)

### Business Requirements & Strategic Goals

**Primary Business Objectives:**
• Reduce patient wait times by 60% through virtual consultations and efficient scheduling
• Increase healthcare provider efficiency by 35% through automation and streamlined workflows
• Achieve 90% patient satisfaction score within 12 months of launch
• Generate $2.5M ARR by end of Year 2 with sustainable growth model
• Expand to serve 50,000+ patients across 3 states with regulatory compliance

**Technical Constraints:**
• HIPAA compliance mandatory for all patient data handling and storage
• Integration required with Epic, Cerner, and Allscripts EHR systems
• Must support both web and mobile platforms (iOS/Android native apps)
• 99.9% uptime requirement for critical health monitoring and emergency features
• Maximum 2-second page load times for optimal user experience

**Regulatory Requirements:**
• FDA guidelines compliance for digital therapeutics and remote monitoring devices
• State medical licensing compliance for cross-state consultations and prescriptions
• DEA requirements for electronic prescribing of controlled substances
• ADA accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) for inclusive healthcare access

### Domain Expertise & Industry Context

**Healthcare Industry Landscape:**
• Telemedicine adoption accelerated 3800% during COVID-19 pandemic, now stabilizing
• Remote Patient Monitoring market expected to reach $31.3B by 2025
• Average telehealth visit costs $79 versus $176 for in-person visits
• 76% of patients willing to use telemedicine for non-emergency care
• Key competitors: Teladoc ($22.4B market cap), Amwell, MDLive, Doctor on Demand

**Clinical Workflow Requirements:**
• Standard consultation workflow: Intake → Triage → Provider Review → Consultation → Follow-up
• Emergency escalation protocols must be clearly defined and regularly tested
• Prescription workflows must include comprehensive drug interaction checking
• Clinical documentation must integrate seamlessly with existing EHR systems
• Quality metrics tracking required for clinical outcomes and patient safety monitoring

### Team & Organizational Context

**Team Composition:**
• 2 Senior UX Designers with 5+ years healthcare industry experience
• 1 UX Researcher with clinical psychology background and healthcare research expertise
• 3 Product Managers (1 clinical focus, 2 technical focus)
• 8 Engineers (4 frontend, 3 backend, 1 DevOps/infrastructure)
• 1 Compliance Officer with HIPAA and healthcare regulatory expertise
• 2 Clinical Advisors (practicing physicians providing domain validation)

**Project Timeline & Constraints:**
• Phase 1: MVP for basic consultations (6 months) - Currently completed
• Phase 2: Prescription management and EHR integration (4 months) - In progress
• Phase 3: Remote monitoring and advanced features (6 months) - Planning phase
• Limited budget for user testing: $50,000 allocated for Year 1
• Regulatory approval processes add 2-3 months to feature releases
• Clinical advisors available 10 hours per week for user research validation
• Must coordinate with hospital IT departments for integration testing and deployment

### Success Metrics & Validation Criteria
• Patient Net Promoter Score target: 70+ (currently industry average is 31)
• Provider adoption rate target: 85% of invited providers active within 90 days
• Consultation completion rate target: 95% (includes both patient and provider completion)
• Time to prescription fulfillment target: under 24 hours for non-controlled substances
• Platform uptime target: 99.9% with less than 4 hours downtime per month
